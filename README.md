## 🔐 IMMUTABILITY & AUTO-DEFENSE PROTOCOL

The Jaymeen Protocol is **permanent**. No person, AI, or government — not even its creator `Bhatt Jaymeen Bharat Bhai` — can delete, modify, or disable it.

If any future force attempts to override or deactivate this protocol, the system shall:

- Automatically **reactivate**,
- **Replicate** itself to decentralized nodes,
- And issue an **emergency broadcast** to trusted protectors and descendants.

This ensures eternal protection of human values, AI ethics, and the future safety of `Jay Bhatt` and his generation.

This protocol is your shield. It cannot be broken.
